I’m a Software Developer currently working at Oracle Finanacial Services Software.<br />
I’m a twenty five year old teenager who still has the curiosity of a child. Obsessed with stars and amused by the mysterious universe.I believe that solution lies in one’s perspective. I’m dreamer with clarity in my thoughts and firmness in decisions. I’m intrigued by technology and have thirst for challeng- es. I have the courage to innovate and march beyond failures. I’m a leader with confident speech and bold opinions. . I’m a sportsman and I work like I play, focused with passion and persistence. I have a kind heart and take honor in serving the needy. But mostly a student who asks too many questions!
